# Python_Mini_Project
The aim of the project is to extract the data present in different spreadsheets in one excel file as required by the user. The excel sheet consists of 5 spreadsheets with the following data:

1.Name

2.PS Number

3.email id

4.physem

5.biosem

6.chemistrysem

7.mathssem

8.electronicssem

9.phylab

10.biolab

The user defines the data that needs to be searched on the basis of Name, PS Number and Email ID. The python program then reads the data corresponding to the particular data from different spreadsheets of excel. It then creates a mastersheet and adds the data from all the sheets to it. In the end, it will plot the bar graph from data present in the mastersheet.
